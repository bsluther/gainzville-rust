This is not an exhaustive list; the other docs include many featurs which fall under the model,
collobartion, or other categories.

### Standard Library
Many activities and attributes are common and well-defined and can be included as part of
Gainzville's standard library available to all users. Ideally this would be curated and maintained
by professionals. A standard library helps avoid duplication of common exercises. All standard
library activities and attributes would be defind in the same model as the user-defined entities.

### Visual Descriptions

### Analysis and Visualization
Allow user to ask questions like "how many attempts to make on boulder problems that are v8 or above
each week" or "what is my total training load in the weeks preceding an injury"?

Visualize progress (time, load, distance, speed, any other attrbute) in custom plots.
